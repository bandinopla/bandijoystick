# ✨💻🐶📱✨  BandiJoystick.js
**Turn a phone into a remote controller!**
No apps. No installations. Just scan & play!

👉 [DEMOS + DOCS](https://bandijoystickjs.web.app/) 👈

**BandiJoystick.js** is a tiny wrapper library around [Trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) to easily allow any phone to be used as a joystick or remote control for your applications / games.

## Usage
```js
import * as BANDI from 'bandijoystick';

const input = new BANDI.Joystick( "Player 1" );

// add some buttons!
input.setKeys( [
	new BANDI.PushKey({
		id:"myCoolBtn",
		radius:"200px",
		onClicked: ()=>console.log("YEEEHH HAAAAAA!")
	})
]);

// listen...
input.connected.on(()=>console.log("Player 1 has joined da game, ya'll!!!"));

//add it to the page
input.domElement().then( el => document.body.appendChild(el) ); 
```

## Motivation
Sometimes I would like to be able to control an app with the phone acting as a remote control, to be able to be on the couch playing a game I made or an app, etc... So that's how the idea came out. It should be trivial ( *I said to myself* ) to use the phone to control things... why not just scan a QR code and that's it? No apps, no weird setup. That's what this aims to be.

## Possible applications
* **For games**: Control the character of your game with your phone or maybe make the phone have some extra buttons to simulate a vehicle's control command? a drone?
* **For conferences**: the speaker can just scan the QR code and gain control of some presentation app easily with no setup.
* **For training**: Training at home or at a gym? Share the laptop's screen to a big TV on the wall and use your phone to control it so everyone can see some big stopwatch or timer.
* **For events**: Share a laptop's screen to a big tv and let people scan the code to register themselves or to get info about their reservation / table / whatever...
* **A restaurant**: Maybe people can scan a qr code to be provided with buttons to call for the waitress or more food, wine, etc...

You do the app, the posibilites are endless!
